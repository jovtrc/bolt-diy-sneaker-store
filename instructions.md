## Instructions to apply the migration to your Supabase database:

1.  Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the SQL editor.
3.  Copy the contents of the `seed.sql` file.
4.  Paste the SQL commands into the SQL editor.
5.  Run the SQL script to insert the sample data into the `products` table.

**Note:** Since the Supabase CLI is not available in this environment, you need to manually run the SQL script in the Supabase dashboard.
